These fixings should only be placed in the overlap section of the membrane and have a low-profile head so that the sheet overlaps can lay flat and rolled evenly for optimum adhesion. Overlapping in vertical applications should be done in the same manner as horizontal applications ensuring subsequent sheet is overlapped by 75mm, adhered, and mechanically fixed correctly before proceeding with the next. The plastic film can be removed immediately in vertical applications. All cut edges and roll ends should be overlapped by 75mm, be clean and dry and sealed with Enviro BSM SeamTape.",,,
