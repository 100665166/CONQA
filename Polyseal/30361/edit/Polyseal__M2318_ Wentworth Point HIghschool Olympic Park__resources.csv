Penetrations such as plumbing and electrical pipes should be stabilized to prevent movement during membrane and concrete placement. For horizontal membrane placement, ensure that the substrate is sound, especially when installing over compacted fill so to avoid displacement from traffic or pouring of concrete. For vertical placement, ensure substrate is sound to provide required support for membrane during concrete placement.",,,"`"
