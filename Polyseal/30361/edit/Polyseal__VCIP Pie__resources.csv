"label","16117643-3a63-5fbd-94bb-22d2469311a6","","note","For horizontal applications, Enviro BSM should be placed with the coloured protective layer facing upwards and the white HDPE layer facing the substrate. Stagger end laps of each run to avoid a build-up of layers. Overlap each previous sheet by 75mm ensuring membranes overlap edge is positioned correctly. Ensure the back of each subsequent roll is clean prior to overlapping and once in place remove the plastic film (on the overlap section) to bond the sheets together. Ensure a complete bond with no creases by using a heavy roller across overlap areas. Once overlap bond is complete the plastic film can be completely removed.",,,

"label","fdd7ec01-ec89-5161-af1e-edbe5df99e8c","","note","Enviro BSM should be mechanically fixed to the substrate using (substrate dependent) fixings with the coloured protective layer facing the concrete pour. These fixings should only be placed in the overlap section of the membrane and have a low-profile head so that the sheet overlaps can lay flat and rolled evenly for optimum adhesion. Overlapping in vertical applications should be done in the same manner as horizontal applications ensuring subsequent sheet is overlapped by 75mm, adhered, and mechanically fixed correctly before proceeding with the next. The plastic film can be removed immediately in vertical applications. All cut edges and roll ends should be overlapped by 75mm, be clean and dry and sealed with Enviro BSM SeamTape.",,,
