Ensure the back of each subsequent roll is clean prior to overlapping and once in place remove the plastic film (on the overlap section) to bond the sheets together. Ensure a complete bond with no creases by using a heavy roller across overlap areas. Once overlap bond is complete the plastic film can be completely removed.",,,
