label,○ Departure may be sudden (e.g. misfit at joint in formwork) or gradual (e.g. a wobble in the surface). Tolerance on gradual departure is the value calculated by multiplying the overall length of the line or surface under consideration by the factor given in Table 15.7.4. MRTS70 CL15.7.4,,,,,,,
