checkpoint-status,Check for any leaks or seepage of epoxy from the crack or nearby areas.,,,,,
checkpoint-status,Verify that epoxy is penetrating through the entire depth and length of the crack.,,,,,
checkpoint-status,"Inspect for the appearance of epoxy at adjacent surfaces, indicating proper penetration.",,,,,
checkpoint-no-status,Finishing and Curing,,,,,
checkpoint-status,Inspect the cured epoxy surface for uniform color and texture.,,,,,
checkpoint-status,"Check for any raised areas, excess epoxy, or irregularities on the surface.",,,,,
checkpoint-status,Verify that the epoxy has properly adhered to the crack edges and surrounding concrete.,,,,,
checkpoint-status,Inspect for any discoloration or blemishes on the surrounding concrete caused by epoxy spillage.,,,,,
