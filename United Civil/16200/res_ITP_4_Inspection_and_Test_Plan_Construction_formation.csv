checkpoint,1 - Subgrade Testing,,,,,,
label,"Activity TASK - Review the results of any Scala Penetrometer tests, CBR tests and Benkelman beam test, and where the target values are not achieved, determine the extent of any further undercuts required. Alternative recommend a modification of the pavement layer thicknesses.",,,,,,
label,Acceptance Criteria - ,,,,,,
label,"• Test Frequency at 15.0m intervals in any one-line, multiple lines or staggered.",,,,,,
label,"• Scala Penetrometer tests to NZS4402.6.5.2at 150,300, 450 and 600 below the final subgrade level. Take supplementary tests as directed by the engineer where any reading is less than the CBR design value. Scala penetrometer values shall be converted to CBR values by engineers experienced in soils engineering and who have experience with the local soils forming the subgrade.",,,,,,
label,"• Carry out in-situ CBR tests to NZS 4402.6.1.3 at 150, 300, 450 below the subgrade level.",,,,,,
label,• Undertake supplementary tests as directed by the engineer where any reading is less than the CBR design values.,,,,,,
label,"• Carry out Benkelman Beam tests on top of the subgrade to TNZ T/1. Where any reading is more than 1.5 times maximum design value, carry out testing at 5.0m intervals either side of the value to determine the extent of the weak area. ",,,,,,

checkpoint,2 - Undercutting,,,,,,
label,Activity TASK - ,,,,,,
label,"• Carefully backfill and compact undercut sections. The minimum undercut size is to be half the road where patchwork is required, or not less than 3.0m width and 5.0m length.",,,,,,
label,"• Undercutting shall not be terminated in a manner that will trap water within the replacement material where material is undercut to a level of 100mm above a drain invert, provide drainage outlet paths either to a subsoil drain, catchpit, or to a free outlet.",,,,,,

label,"– Subgrade CBR <3% (Undercut 300mm Apply geotextile fabric to cut surface, Backfill with sub basecourse).",,,,,,
label,– Subgrade <4% (Undercut 100mm and backfill with sub base course) – Subgrade <5% (Apply geogrid).,,,,,,
label,– Benkelman Beam >3mm (Undercut 500mm and backfill with sand. Apply geotextile fabric to top surface of sand),,,,,,
label,– Benkelman Beam >4mm (Undercut 300mm and apply geotextile fabric to cut surface backfill with sub basecourse),,,,,,
label,– Benkelman Beam >6mm (undercut 100mm and backfill with sub basecourse),,,,,,
label,– Benkelman Beam >8mm (Apply geogrid) ,,,,,,
label,– Subgrade CBR <2% (Cement/Lime stabilise 300mm depth. (Refer 8616 Lime treatment of sub-Grades). ,,,,,,

checkpoint,4 - Stringing,,,,,,
label,Activity TASK - ,,,,,,
label,"• Check the formation prior to the placement of sub-basecourse material, by stringing in the presence of the engineer, to ensure that the pavement is constructed to the specified tolerances.",,,,,,
label,• Do not undertake subsequent phases of the work until stringing is completed and the work approved by the engineer.,,,,,,
label,• Pull string lines taut between level pegs. Place level pegs clear of the construction; they shall remain in place during all phases of construction prior to sealing.,,,,,,
label,"• Mark pegs to show their relationship to seal or kerb levels. When kerbs have been laid and approved as level, they may substitute for level pegs. ",,,,,,
label,Acceptance Criteria - ,,,,,,
label,• Acceptance by Engineer.,,,,,,
label,• Take measurements on roads at the centreline and at each edge and at not more than 5m intervals along the string. Take string measurements at intervals not exceeding 100m along the construction. Check levels by 'eyeing in' longitudinally at the surface level. ,,,,,,
label,• Additional Survey report will be provided with additional 12 shots per 100m.,,,,,,

checkpoint,5 - Formation Level,,,,,,
label,Activity TASK - ,,,,,,
label,• Following verification of the design subgrade CBR the surface of the subgrade shall betrimmed to line and level to achieve an even grade between level control points.,,,,,,
label,"• Ensure the surface of the formation level conforms to the levels and grades within tolerances of 0mm to minus 25mm and that no point in the general surface varies by more than 15mm from either a 3.0m straight edge laid parallel to the centreline of the road, or from a camber board placed at right angles to the centreline. No part of the sub-grade shall have undulations that could cause ponding.",,,,,,
label,• The area of subgrade brought to completion on any one day shall not exceed that which can satisfactorily be covered with metal on the same day.,,,,,,
