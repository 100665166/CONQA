checkpoint,Correct tooling used to fold edges of panels. Panel returns folded neatly and square,,,,,,,
checkpoint,"Panel cleaned of any excess cutting lubricant or foreign debris. Back of panel is cleaned at panel stiffener and perimeter angle extrusion locations, as are perimeter angle extrusions and stiffener contact surfaces as per DOW recommendations and ITP completed.",,,,,,,
checkpoint,Correct sized mill finished aluminum 20x20x3 EA 6351 -T6 run full length of perimeter folds and finish no more than 30mm from edge of panel.,,,,,,,
checkpoint,20x3EA cleaned with clean cloth and isopropanol prior to structural silicone and structural spacer tape application. Continuous 7mm wide x 6mm high structural glazing spacer tape applied down the length of the 20x3EA flush with the backside of the uptuned edge of angle. Dowsil 795 Structural Silicon used to adhere perimeter angle to back of panel. Dowsil 795 to be applied continuously maintaining 6mm thick x 13mm wide bead adjacent to structural glazing spacer tape. 20x3EA applied firmly to back of cladding panel and snug against folded claddding panel return.,,,,,,,
checkpoint,Continuous mill finished 20x3 EA perimenter angle connected to folded cladding return fold via Hobson 4.8mm dia stainless steel rivets at max 300mm centers,,,,,,,
checkpoint,Correct sizes angle cleated selected and installed to match engraving on back of panel (32mmx20mmx3mm mill finished 6351-T6 alumnium angle cleats @ 150mm long or 25mmx20mmx3 mill finished 6351-T6 alumnium @ 75mm long) located around perimeter of panel. Cleats fixed through cladding panel perimeter fold and 20x3EA via 4.8mm dia stainless steel rivets. Rivets at 100mm spacing to 150mm long cleats and 50mm spacing for 75mm cleats. Rivet spacings generally not greater than 300mm. Cleats to have 9mm dia oversized expansion holes drilled at required centers and edge distances.,,,,,,,
