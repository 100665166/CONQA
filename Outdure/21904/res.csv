checkpoint-status,"Any butt joins on the surface of the decking area, must be arised ideally with a small butt plane to remove the sharp edge of the square-cut decking board.The gaps on each butt-join are determined by the temperature onsite on the day of installation eg; The boards are being laid in midday summer sun & are at the max capacity in terms of expansion/growth (0.5mm optimal gap), Or the boards are being unloaded off the pallet cold to the touch-first thing onsite in the early morning (3-4mm optimal gap.)",,,,,,,
checkpoint-status,"Once 1/4 of the deck install has been completed it is important to preserve the surface the use of (drop sheets, rubber matting, protective fabrics, etc) while the install is being undertaken & critical for a handover period to the customer/main contractor that the new deck is completely free of any type of damage, cosmetic scratches, etc. (take photo)",,,,,,,
