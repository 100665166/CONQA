The displacement of the production anchors are to be measured at each of the loading points outlined in Table 4 (snippet below) · The locations of the anchors to be tested shall be decided onsite with the Geotechnical Professional. · Test loads will be supplied by the Designer prior to acceptance testing. · Anchor testing criteria in accordance with New Zealand Ground Anchor design Guideline Section 7.4.5 of the 'FHWA-IF-99-015-Ground Anchors and Anchored Systems'. Anchors must meet the following acceptance criteria: 1. In order for the load test to be considered stable the total movement measured during the required load hold at the design test load should not exceed 1 mm between 1 to 10 minutes. If it is greater than 1 mm the load shall be held for an additional 50 minutes - in this time the creep shall not exceed 2 mm between 6 to 60 minutes. If creep is greater than 2 mm following this time period contact the Geotechnical Designer or design team representative for guidance. 2. The apparent free length shall not be greater than the jack length plus 100% of the unbonded length plus 50% of the bonded length. The apparent free length is back calculated from the elastic movement measured during the load test, contact the geotechnical designer or design team representative for guidance",,,
