Where Type B material contains 25% or more of rock by volume, which will not break down during compaction to meet the maximum particle dimension required for a 200 mm thick layer, the loose thickness of each layer may equal 125% of the typical maximum particle dimension of the rock up to a maximum layer thickness of 500 mm. Any rock with a maximum particle dimension greater than 80% of the loose thickness of the layer shall be removed. The material shall be placed and compacted such that voids are completely filled with fine material. Type B material containing rock with a particle dimension greater than 150 mm after compaction shall not be placed within 400 mm of the top of Type B and/or Type C material zones.",,,,
