label,FREQUENCY: Each Weld,,,,,,
label,ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: Rails and components shall be clamped in position prior to welding.,,,,,,
label,○ Welding of the joint shall be carried out as a continuous operation. A disruption to the procedure may require additional preheating.,,,,,,
label,○ All weld ends shall be welded using an overlapping back welding technique over the weld for a minimum length of 20 mm to ensure that all craters are fully filled to the full cross section of the weld.,,,,,,
