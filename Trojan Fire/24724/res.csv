Do not allow TFP apprentices to carry out pressure testing without close supervision.,,,,,,
label,NOTE: Air testing is only required to be performed when there is a risk of water damage to finished floors or furnished buildings.,,,,,,
label,"NOTE: LL requires 24 hours notice for water and 48 hour notice for air, this will be communicated in the builder’s brief. This has been added to swms. Provide schematics, pressure source location, pressure relief device, equipment used, calibration certificates that will be used are to be included in the ITP submission to the builder's brief.",,,,,,
label,"NOTE: Ensure suitable warning signage is displayed at all entrances and exits to area of pressure testing being carried out stating “warning TFP pressure testing pipe work”. Notify builders foreman and supervisors that the relevant levels, risers or areas are being pressure tested.",,,,,,
checkpoint,"Prior to using TFP mobile air compressor, ensure that the pre set 400kpa pressure relief valve has been fitted to the pipe work being tested as a fail safe of over pressurisation. Visually inspect the TFP air compressor being used for the test to ensure no damage to the compressor assembly and hoses. Check to ensure pressure gauge fitted to TFP test manifold is operational. Note, any air testing above 80kpa requires test plan approved by LL regional EHS manager.",,,,,,
checkpoint,Install TFP's certified pressure gauge with test certificate that is valid and in date to the system/area of pipe work being tested,,,,,,

checkpoint,"Once all inspection/checks have been completed and TFP’s mobile air compressor test pump is connected, ensure pre action system main stop valve is closed, turn air compressor on and prove air is available. Open air compressor discharge/outlet valve and fill system to 100kpa, then close discharge/outlet valve. Visually walk the area under test to check for any air leaks.",,,,,,
checkpoint,"If no obvious air leaks and pressure holding at 100kpa for a period of 20 minutes, open discharge/outlet valve on TFP's mobile air compressor test pump and pressurise to 300kpa or 1 and a 1/2 times system working pressure. Check area under test for any air leaks then hold required pressure for two hours. A TFP employee is to remain watching the testing for the entire duration.",,,,,,
checkpoint,"After test completion ensure main stop valve is padlocked closed. Slowly reduce air pressure to 0 through the pre action system drain valve. Once pressure gauge is reading 0, disconnect TFP’s air compressor test pump from the pre action system and connect systems permanent air compressor ready for system simulation test.",,,,,,
checkpoint,Confirm pre action system solenoid operates on fire alarm in the protected area when smoked detector is forced into alarm with test smoke.,,,,,,
checkpoint,"Ensuring the main stop valve is still in the closed position, re-pressurise the dry pipe pre action system with air utilising the permanent systems air compressor to its pre set systems working pressure of 200kpa of air. Then close systems down stream test valve above pre action valve set to prevent system being flooded with water. Open the main stop valve below pre action valve so system is primed and in its normal operational setting. Introduce smoke to simulate smoke detectors going into alarm and operating solenoid. Simulate a loss of air pressure through the pre action valve set drain valve, actuating the pre action system to operate and come into alarm.",,,,,,
checkpoint,Ensure TFP chargehand is supervising the pressure test at all times and inspects pipework while it is under test pressure. Arrange for client to witness the two-hour pressure test.,,,,,,
