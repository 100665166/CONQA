,,Review inspection details,,Review inspection details above to verify that all inspections are satisfactory and test procedures can now follows. Ensure TFP chargehand carries out/supervises the pressure testing and remains with the TFP pressure test pump while tests are in progress. Do not allow TFP apprentices to carry out pressure testing without close supervision.,Test Procedure,
,,A) Connect air compressor to above/down stream of main stop valve,,"A) Connect air compressor to above/down stream of the main stop valve on the system to be tested. ensure main stop valve is closed. Fill pipework with compressed air to 100kpa. inspect pipework under test for obvious leakage. Re-check pressure gauge and if no major pressure loss, pump to 200kpa. Hold at 200kpa for 10 minutes. If no obvious air leakage from pipework being tested, release air pressure via drain valve/remote test valve. Disconnect air compressor from system.",Test Procedure,
,,(B) Ensure pressure switch cutting out at its set pressure,,"(B) Prior to using TFP mobile pressure test pump or the construction sites fire water pressure test pump, ensure that the pressure switch is cutting out at its set pressure and no more than a maximum of 2200kpa. Visually inspect the TFP pressure pump being used for the test to ensure no damage to pump assembly and hoses. Check to ensure pressure gauge fitted to TFP pressure pump is operational. Note, any testing above 2200kpa requires test plan approved by LL regional EHS manager.",Test Procedure,
,,(C) Install TFP's certified pressure gauge with valid test certificate,,(C) Install TFP's certified pressure gauge with test certificate that is valid and in date to the system/area of pipe work being tested,Test Procedure,
,,(D) Ensure TFP mobile pressure test pump supply/inlet water connection,,(D) Ensure TFP mobile pressure test pump supply/inlet water connection is connected to a suitable domestic/fire water supply using standard low pressure hose fittings.,Test Procedure,
,,(E) Ensure TFP's mobile pressure test pump discharge/outlet water connected,,"(E) Ensure TFP's mobile pressure test pump discharge/outlet water connector is connected to the pipe work to be tested above/down stream of the main stop valve either using roll grove, gal mal screwed or high-pressure hoses.",Test Procedure,
,,(F) Ensure sprinkler main stop valve is closed,,"(F) Once all inspection/checks have been completed and TFP’ mobile pressure test pump is connected, ensure sprinkler main stop valve is closed, open supply/inlet and prove water is available. Open discharge/outlet valve and fill system to towns main pressure (500kpa) removing the air through remote test/air bleed valve as you fill pipe work, then close discharge/outlet valve. if using the hydrant riser water supply to fill system through valve set, open sprinkler main stop valve and fill system to 500kpa then close main stop valve again, removing the air through remote test/air bleed valve as you fill pipe work. Visually walk the area under test to check for any water leaks.",Test Procedure,
,,(G) Check area under test for any water leaks,,"(G) If no obvious water leaks and pressure holding at 500kpa for a period of 20 minutes, open discharge/outlet valve on TFP's mobile pressure test pump, turn pump on and pressurise to 1600kpa for sprinkler systems and 1750kpa for hydrant/hose reel systems. Check area under test for any water leaks then hold required pressure for two hours. If using the hydrant riser water supply in conjunction with TFP construction water pressure pump, have one person at all times manning the pump in direct phone or radio link with the person stationed at the valve set. open sprinkler main stop valve and fill system to required pressure (1600kpa for sprinklers and 1750kpa for hydrant/hose reel systems) then close main stop valve. Check area under test for any water leaks then hold required pressure for two hours. A TFP employee is to remain watching the testing for the entire duration.",Test Procedure,
,,(H) Ensure main stop valve padlocked closed after test completion,,(H) After test completion ensure main stop valve is padlocked closed. Reduce pressure to 1000kpa which will remain at all times in the sprinkler systems until handover of the project.,Test Procedure,
,,(J) Ensure TFP chargehand supervising pressure test at all times,,(J) Ensure TFP chargehand is supervising the pressure test at all times and inspects pipework while it is under test pressure. Arrange for client to witness the two-hour pressure test. (W),Test Procedure,
