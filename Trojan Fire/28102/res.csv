Check area under test for any water leaks then hold required pressure for two hours. If using the hydrant riser water supply in conjunction with TFP construction water pressure pump, have one person at all times manning the pump in direct phone or radio link with the person stationed at the valve set. open sprinkler main stop valve and fill system to required pressure (1600kpa for sprinklers and 1750kpa for hydrant/hose reel systems) then close main stop valve.

checkpoint-group,Test Procedure,,,,,,,
checkpoint-status,Review inspection details above to verify that all inspections are satisfactory and test procedures can now follows. Ensure TFP chargehand carries out/supervises the pressure testing and remains with the TFP pressure test pump while tests are in progress. Do not allow TFP apprentices to carry out pressure testing without close supervision.,,,,,,,
label,NOTE: Air testing is only required to be performed when there is a risk of water damage to finished floors or furnished buildings.,,,,,,,
label,"NOTE: LL requires 24 hours notice for water and 48 hour notice for air, this will be communicated in the builder’s brief. This has been added to swms. Provide schematics, pressure source location, pressure relief device, equipment used, calibration certificates that will be used are to be included in the ITP submission to the builder's brief.",,,,,,,
label,"NOTE: Ensure suitable warning signage is displayed at all entrances and exits to area of pressure testing being carried out stating “warning TFP pressure testing pipe work”. Notify builders foreman and supervisors that the relevant levels, risers or areas are being pressure tested.",,,,,,,

checkpoint-status,"A) Connect air compressor to above/down stream of the main stop valve on the system to be tested. ensure main stop valve is closed. Fill pipework with compressed air to 100kpa. inspect pipework under test for obvious leakage. Re-check pressure gauge and if no major pressure loss, pump to 200kpa. Hold at 200kpa for 10 minutes. If no obvious air leakage from pipework being tested, release air pressure via drain valve/remote test valve. Disconnect air compressor from system.",,,,,,,
