The number of samples shall be at least one for projects involving less than 100m of pipe, two for projects up to 200m length, etc. “A satisfactory result is s <1 MPN/100ml for E.coli and Total Coliforms and less than 20 CFU/ml for Heterotrophic Plate Counts.” If E.coli is detected the pipeline shall be swabbed, flushed, disinfected, flushed again and then the bacteriological tests repeated. The process shall be repeated until such time a clear test is recorded. Note: There are high risks of test failure due to sample contamination so it is recommended that the testing laboratory is also involved in collecting the sample.",,,,,,,
