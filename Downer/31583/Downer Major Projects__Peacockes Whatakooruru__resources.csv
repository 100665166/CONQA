The pavement design requires a soaked CBR of not less than 10 within 1.0m of the bottom of the SIL layer. Subgrade CBRs testing includes 4x DCP's at subgrade level to a depth of 1m in a 1m grid around the CBR test location and 4x NDM's DT -0.1m subgrade level with a probe depth of 300mm in a grid. CBR testing is then completed (For Subgrades in cut or fill 1 x In-situ CBR test (truck mounted CBR), Push tube CBR for subgrades in cut and remoulded CBR sample for subgrades in fill). Another 400mm material is then cut, 4 x NDMs are completed around the test location and CBR testing is completed. If the soaked CBR is less than 10 the Engineer may instruct changes to the pavement design. Invitation for engineer to witness CBR testing. To be accurate representation of site materials.",,,
