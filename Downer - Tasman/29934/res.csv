section,SECTION 3 – RECEIVING INSPECTIONS,,,,,,,
checkpoint,1 -  Capping Layer Compaction,,,,,,,
label,Inspection Point: Quality Control Activity - Filling is to be carried out in horizontal even layers not exceeding 0.15m in loose thickness and is to be thoroughly compacted with appropriate equipment.  Total thickness of the capping layer (existing and new material) is to be not less than 1 .0m after compaction at any point.,,,,,,,
label,Acceptance Criteria - Density of at least 97% of maximum dry density with moisture content between OMC +2% and OMC + 4%. ,,,,,,,
label,Verifying Document - Density Report,,,,,,,
label,Frequency - Tests to be done every 350m3 of fill using a nuclear densometer. 2x for every 10m x 5m area of capping,,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Type (Visual, other) - NDM Testing",,,,,,,
checkpoint,2 - Capping Layer Air Voids,,,,,,,
label,Inspection Point: Quality Control Activity -  The air voids content of the capping layer shall be calculated for each density test.,,,,,,,
label,"Acceptance Criteria - Air voids shall not exceed 6% for each single test, and shall not exceed 5% for a running average of 5 consecutive tests. The air voids calculation using a nuclear densometer for a single test will comprise an average calculated from the results of 4 density measurements. Each measurement position shall be located by rotating the densometer about the density probe in 45 degree increments. The test area is to be trimmed level and smoothed below the compacted surface.",,,,,,,
label,Verifying Document - Density Report,,,,,,,
label,Frequency - 2x for every 10m x 5m area of capping,,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Type (Visual, other) - NDM Testing",,,,,,,
checkpoint,3 - Undrained Strength of Capping Layer,,,,,,,
label,Acceptance Criteria - Single test minimum value of 85kPa and a running average for 10 consecutive tests minimum value of 100kPa,,,,,,,
label,Verifying Document - Field Testing Document,,,,,,,
label,Frequency - Test shall be done on a 25m x 25m grid. A single test comprises an average of six readings from within a 1m square area.,,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Type (Visual, other) - Visual",,,,,,,
checkpoint,4 - Permeability Test,,,,,,,
label,Inspection Point: Quality Control Activity - Permeability Test on Capping Layer as per specifications,,,,,,,
label,Acceptance Criteria - No greater then 1x10^-7m/s,,,,,,,
label,Verifying Document - Field Testing Document,,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Type (Visual, other) - Field Testing",,,,,,,
checkpoint,5 - Capping Approval and Topsoiling,,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Point: Quality Control Activity - The capping layer is to be kept moist, as described above, until the topsoil layer has been placed over it, following an inspection and approval. The topsoil layer is to be lightly rolled.",,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Type (Visual, other) - Hold point",,,,,,,
holdpoint,AUTHORITY HOLDPOINT,,,,,,,
checkpoint,6 - Compaction Trial,,,,,,,
label,"Inspection Point: Quality Control Activity - A compaction trial is to be carried out using representative samples of the capping material before commencement of the capping layer construction to determine the compaction effort required to meet the specified density, undrained shear strength and air voids criteria. The compaction trial is to consist, as a minimum, of the construction of a 10m x 5m area of capping, constructed to the full make-up depth of 1 .0m. ",,,,,,,
label,"Acceptance Criteria - For the trial to be considered successful it is to meet the criteria stated for 2 density and air voids tests, 5 shear vane tests and 1 permeability test.",,,,,,,
label,Verifying Document - Go ahead from NTRLBU,,,,,,,
