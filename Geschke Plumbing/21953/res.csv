label,Copper systems are failing in the construction industry due to stagnate water being left in both hot and cold copper pipelines. Copper needs to form a protective layer of copper oxide on the internal surface which is formed by the contact with fresh aerated and oxygenated water. Periodic flushing of the systems is the only way to ensure this occurs.,,,,,,
