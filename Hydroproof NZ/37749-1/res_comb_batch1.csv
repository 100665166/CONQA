label,"○ The inspection should concentrate on “high risk” areas such as drains and outlets equipment, as well as a general inspection of the entire car park. Inspections should also include the examination of the car park deck if possible from the underside for evidence of leaks, deteriorated decking, structural cracks or movement and other deficiencies. Parapets and edging should also be examined for evidence of cracking, deterioration and moisture infiltration.",,,,,,,

label,To get the longest life from a WABO joint it must be regularly inspected & maintained.,,,,,,,
label,"When first installed there should be inspections each spring and autumn, to enable the effects of annual extremes of weather to be checked by the approved WABO installer.",,,,,,,
label,WABO joints are exposed to different levels of movement to the rest of the structure which may require more frequent inspection.,,,,,,,
label,"Any inspection of a WABO joint should include the interior of the building for signs of water penetration or condensation and for alterations, which may have affected the WABO joint. Externally, abutting construction, which can affect the performance of the WABO joint, should also be inspected.",,,,,,,
label,Annual Inspections & Cleaning,,,,,,,
label,○ Inspections,,,,,,,
label," — The inspection should concentrate on “high risk” areas, such as cover plates and fixings also a general inspection around the WABO joint. Inspections should also include the examination of the underside for evidence of leaks, if possible.",,,,,,,
label, — Deteriorated structural cracks or movement and other defects in the surrounding area of the WABO joint should also be inspected to ensure the WABO joint will continue to work as intended.,,,,,,,
label,○ Damage,,,,,,,
label," — If damage is found on the WABO joint it should be repaired immediately by an approved WABO Applicator. They will use WABO component products and special techniques to achieve neat, un-obtrusive reinstatement of the WABO joint",,,,,,,
label,○ Cleaning,,,,,,,
label," — Location, traffic level, effective drainage, and service use will dictate cleaning requirements. Sweeping clean followed by hose and broom washing of the WABO joint is recommended, not water blasting.",,,,,,,
label,○ Annual Authorized Service Checks,,,,,,,
label," — To maintain your warranty, every year you must have the Approved WABO installer who carried out the installation to inspect the WABO and ensure it remains in good condition.",,,,,,,
label," — The installer will thoroughly check the WABO joint for signs of damage, water ingress or potential problems. As well, they will also check on the condition of the WABO joint.",,,,,,,
label, — These checks are inexpensive and are the best way to ensure the WABO joints continues to work as intended and stays in top condition.,,,,,,,
label,○ Year one checks,,,,,,,
