label,"Express Plumbing uses a online live document system of recording different stages of the construction process through out the build program. With the aid of mobile devices and computers we record with photographic evidence the construction build process, what things look like behind walls and below ground. We follow up these photos with the end product finish and have checkpoints for each fixture to have passed off at each stage so you can be assured of the quality Express Plumbing has archived during your project.",,,,,,,
label,"The system provides a accurate recording of what has happened on site and also provides a means of recording and resolving any defects. During checkpoint sign offs for each fixture a series of questions are asked in relation to the fixture, ie “are the pipes coming out of the wall straight?” or “Has the council inspection been passed?”. If the Express Plumbing site supervisor finds a defect he is able to send a job request immediately to any of his site staff and the repairing staff member is able to take a photo of his repair for the supervisor to approve.",,,,,,,
label,All dates and time of data entered or altered are recorded next to each question. Our commissioning processes also forms part of this live document with specific fixture questions and photos during the commissioning being recorded i.e. temperature gauge photo of a running hot tap on a basin etc. We are also able to provide our Fire Register through the same system and record locations with the labels and assign a photo of each penetration to that location. We also break down the locations into areas and floors.,,,,,,,
label,As built are also recorded during the project and are loaded into the system before the hole or ceiling is covered in. These can be on request turned into any format you may wish to have these sent to you (there may be additional costs).,,,,,,,
label,"Express Plumbing supervisor’s are authorised and given access to the specific job they may be running. Access is only given through Web page authorisation from the Express Project Management team. On site teams under the supervisor do not have full access to the system and can only log repairs to defects with in the system. All on site data entry, passing off of fixture, logging of finished works, fire register recording and As built entry may only be preformed by the authorised Express Plumbing Site Supervisor.",,,,,,,
