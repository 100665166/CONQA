During checkpoint sign offs for each fixture a series of questions are asked in relation to the fixture, ie “are the pipes coming out of the wall straight?” or “Has the council inspection been passed?”. If the Express Plumbing site supervisor finds a defect he is able to send a job request immediately to any of his site staff and the repairing staff member is able to take a photo of his repair for the supervisor to approve.",,,
