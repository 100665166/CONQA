d3c5d674-6ad5-5b9c-be28-b591b43a6661,note,"Provide a continuous supply of concrete, such that each pile hole is concrete in one uninterrupted operation. All concrete placed must have the nominated workability of the approved concrete mix, at the time of placement in the pile hole",,,,
069df959-95f4-5f50-a9f5-a07edb1909d3,note,"Unless specified otherwise, place the concrete as per TfNSW Specification B80",,,,

d704df8f-1e0e-5081-8596-02efa7d548c3,note,"Use a tremie pipe and hopper to place the concrete. The tremie pipe must be rigid and watertight throughout. Tape a steel plate to the bottom end of the tremie pipe or similar, prior to placing concrete, and select a suitable tremie size and concrete pump (if needed)",,,,
f0814004-d4e1-5a7f-af77-f23b23dc68d5,note,"Place the concrete in a continuous process from the base to above the top of the pile, in a manner and consistency such that pockets of air, water or ground materials are not entrapped in the concrete, and the concrete cover completely consists of sound concrete",,,,
07157f25-d0a0-5856-b44b-5fc1a3d29893,note,"During concreting, maintain a record of the depth of the tremie pipe outlet against the level of the concrete in the pile hole, and the corresponding volume of concrete placed.",,,,
,note,"During concreting, lift the tremie pipe progressively as the concrete level rises, but at all times keeping the bottom end of the tremie pipe a minimum of 2 m below the top surface of the concrete until sound concrete appears at a minimum of 400 mm above the pile cut-off level, to avoid defective concrete at or below cut-off level.",,,,
,note,"Retain other relevant records, such as concrete pour dockets and records",,,,
