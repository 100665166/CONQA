checkpoint,Position damper centrally in penetration aperture as per system drawing with IBS backing rod and temporary supports or packers. ,,,,,,
checkpoint,Galvanised steel casing positioned centrally within aperture is 0.7mm or greater gauge,,,,,,
checkpoint,"Killargo fire rated mastic has been applied to the gaps between fire damper, casing perimeter & building element on both sides.Gaps between the fire damper and wall no greater than 25mm.Ensure fill depth is 50mm.No evidence of cracking.",,,,,,
checkpoint,"0.7mm minimum steel angles at least twice the width of the penetration gap, fixed to damper casing with steel screws, bolts or pip rivets and fixed to wall with steel fixings at maximum 150mm centre spacing or 2 per side for casing lengths up to 250mm or 3 per side for casing lengths 251-400mm",,,,,,
checkpoint,Ductwork is connected to either side of the casing with nylon bolts on the flanges as per the AS1682.2 break away joint method. Bolts do not exceed an 8mm diameter.,,,,,,
checkpoint,Access panel is provided to conveniently access fire damper for visual and/or maintenance inspections.,,,,,,

checkpoint,Does the fire damper mounting frame completely penetrates the wall or slab into which it is installed?,,,,,,
checkpoint,"Does the damper mounting frame retained either, on both sides by means of flanges butted against the face of the wall or slab and fixed to the mounting frame or on one side by one flange only, fixed to the wall and damper frame allowing the damper body to expand without distortion to the blades? ",,,,,,
checkpoint,Does the penetration for the fire damper have clearance on all sides equal to half the width of the flange used to retain the damper frame? ,,,,,,
checkpoint,Is this clearance filled with an approved non-combustible compressible material such as rockwool to the full thickness of te wall or slab involved?,,,,,,
checkpoint,Does the method of attaching ductwork to fire damper ensure that the damper remains functional if the ductwork is damaged in any way and must allow the ductwork to fall away? ,,,,,,
checkpoint,Access panel is provided to conveniently access fire damper for visual and/or maintenance inspections.,,,,,,
