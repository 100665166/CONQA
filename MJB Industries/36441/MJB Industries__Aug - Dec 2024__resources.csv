If the test specimen fails, a further two samples should be selected at random from two components of the same type and batch as represented by the original test piece. Should one or both samples fail, the customer may reject components from the batch and may also specify that the frequency of testing be increased to 1 per 50 items produced or one of each week’s production until it can be demonstrated, by five consecutive complying tests, that the specified limit for test failure is not being exceeded.",,,,
