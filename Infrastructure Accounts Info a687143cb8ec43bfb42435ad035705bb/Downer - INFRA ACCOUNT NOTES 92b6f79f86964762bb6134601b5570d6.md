***NOTE: As of 2023, Downer now has multiple accounts (Cantebury, CCA Waikoto, Central Otago & Southland, Otago, Tasman). The notes below only apply to those in the MAJOR PROJECTS account.***

All Major Projects have Overall Progress matrices that usually use either section names or high level folders to display column progress. If a new ITP includes different names for their sections/folders, be sure to update the matrix as well. |

**Red** = requires a signoff on the checklist
**Yellow** = internal holdpoint; *does not* require a signoff for the checklist

Sections should always use the *SECTION* title (e.g. **SECTION 3 – PRE-CONSTRUCTION (P&G / ESTABLISHMENT**).

There’s no need to use the sub-section names (e.g. **3.01 Site Requirements**) unless there isn’t a *SECTION* title on the supplied ITP. |

All columns (except for those under “Checked by”) are used.

Don’t forget to add “*Client Final Inspection - Contractor*” and “*Client Final Inspection - BBO Engineer*” checkpoints at the end of the ITP (both require holdpoints). |

○ Item + Construction Step or Material as the checkpoint’s name
○ Method/Description
○ Test frequency
○ Contractor
○ Designer
○ Verifying Records Checklists, Test and Supplier Certificates

Iain may also define additional (or less) columns depending on the ITP. Pay attention to any columns shaded in a different colour.

Holdpoints vary on an ITP-to-ITP basis. Any holdpoints defined under ‘Contract’ ***do not*** require a signoff, whereas a holdpoint defined for ‘Designer’ ***will*** require a signoff to be added. |
