# TREC Alliance - INFRA ACCOUNT NOTES

## Account Info

| **Location:** | NZ |
| --- | --- |
| **AM:** | [Sudeshan](https://www.notion.so/Sudeshan-3f31f4bf44b24c449faf72f63bcdce88?pvs=21) |
| **Notes:** | Account has eight zones (A-B). All share the exact same checklists and ITPs.

Note that ITPs ***must*** follow a very specific naming format:
ITP - **A/B/C/D/G/E/F#$** - **PROJECT NAME** - **ITP NAME**

…where:
**A/B/C/D/G/E/F#$** ← This is an alphanumeric code for the specific project. It can be pulled off the supplied spreadsheet/Word doc/PDF filename or from the *Contract Name:* field at the top of the ITP details.

**PROJECT NAME** ← Name of the contract/project. Usually taken from the filename (if available) or from the *Contract Name:* field at the top of the ITP details.

**ITP NAME** ← Name of the supplied ITP. If the filename doesn’t have it displayed, grab it off the *Procedure:* field under the ITP details table.

Example of what this looks like in practice:
***ITP - C1503B - Mautaua Under Slip - Master ITP***

Try to ensure that they share the same template IDs to make updates (if needed) easier to manage. If necessary, you can upload it to the account library first, pull a resource extract, and then copy the ID that the system generates for you. |

## Project

| **Project Name** | **Project Notes** | **Formatting Reqmnts (Link to new page if necessary)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Zone A-B** | Link (Global/Account)
[https://dashboard.con.qa/#/account/2f082068-6b1e-4b9a-9054-a014b8b476c6](https://dashboard.con.qa/#/account/2f082068-6b1e-4b9a-9054-a014b8b476c6) | ○ All columns are required with the exception of unnecessary ones like **Initials**, **CPS Engineer Initials (Grey if not required)**, **Date(s)**, etc.

○ A standalone checkpoint (or section if it’s a sectioned ITP) called “**Project Site reps.**” needs to always be present at the start of every ITP. It should look like this:

**checkpoint	Project Site reps.**
*textbox	CPS Eng.
textbox	Site Engineer
textbox	Quality Eng.*

**(!!!)** Note that the “**Project Site reps.**” fields may not always be named the same. Adjust the textbox names accordingly if there are any differences from the supplied ITP. |
