# Metropolitan Road Programs Alliance - INFRA ACCOUNT NOTES

## Account Info

| **Location:** | Melbourne
 |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality Engineers:** | **Victor Mira** (primarily responsible for Camms Rd, Clyde Rd, and Progress St)
**Jon de Castro** (primarily in charge of Brunt Rd) |
| **AM:** | [Sudeshan](https://www.notion.so/Sudeshan-3f31f4bf44b24c449faf72f63bcdce88?pvs=21) |
| **Notes:** | Slowly transitioning to using the new ‘*date*’ format for any ITPs that require it.
***Keep in mind that older ITPs will still be using textboxes rather than ‘date’!***

Template names need to be different from checklist names (i.e. **ITP-010-STR-CFA Piling** ← Checklist name vs. **ITP-010-STR-CFA Piling Rev 0** ← Template name)

Watch out for extra textboxes that may or may not be needed on the ITP. They’ll usually be prefixed as “ENTER: Teambinder Number” (or anything else along those lines).

Needs a “*Referenced Documentation*” section + checkpoint at the start of every checklist with the following labels (in order):

**Document Title:
ITP Description:
Document Number (in Teambinder):** *MRP-0000-MRPA-ALT-ITP-00XX*
**Discipline (e.g. CIV/STR/RAIL):
Revision Number:
Revision Date:
ITP created by:
ITP approved for use by:**

**(!!!)** ***Watch out for ITP requests being sent through for more than one project!***
The Quality Engineer from one project might tell you to add a new ITP to two or more different projects even if they aren’t the QE for those other projects.

You can start building the ITP and adding it to the checklist library for the QE that made the original request. However, don’t add it to other projects managed by the other QEs yet; ***always check first with the QEs of the other project(s)*** to see if it’s OK to do so.

**Example:**
– Jon De Castro (Brunt Rd) requests to have an ITP added to both Brunt Rd and Camms Rd.
– Clarify with Victor Mira (the QE for Camms Rd) if it’s OK to have it added to that project’s library too. You can ask them in the same ticket since all the QEs are automatically CC’d in Zendesk. |
