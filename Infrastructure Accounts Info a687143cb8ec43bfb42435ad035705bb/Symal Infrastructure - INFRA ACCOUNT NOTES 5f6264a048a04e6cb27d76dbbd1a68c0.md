○ Remarks / record column field to be included only if specified (usually along the lines of a label titled as “Attach As-Builts”, etc.).

○ Acceptable Criteria are used as checkpoints.

○ Any sub-criteria items need to be displayed as buttons within the same checkpoint with values for PASS,FAIL,N/A.

○ Holdpoints are only required if a key for CYP D&C JV or IR is listed.
Example: Key has “IR/CYP(R)” listed → needs to have three buttons as follows:

**button** REVIEW POINT - Signature by CYP D&C JV
**values** Yes,No

**button** REVIEW POINT - Signature by Symal Infrastructure
**values** Yes,No

**holdpoint** Request Sign Off

*N.B. Maher may ask for extra checkpoints to be added at the end of some ITPs. These are usually just simple checkpoints (**not** checkpoint-no-status) that have a heading along the lines of “Attach Subcontractor ITP” or “Attach Drawings”, etc.* |

○ Use all ITP headers as labels (Activity, Ref docs, Acceptance criteria, etc.).

○ Include buttons for any acceptance criteria questions (i.e. **button** Has all of the above been completed? **values** Yes,No,N/A)

Beginning from 09-11-23 onwards, all ITPs must now have the following checkpoint at the very top of the ITP:

**Section - ITP Details
Checkpoint - ITP Details (THIS CAN BE A CHECKPOINT NO STATUS IF IT WON'T REMAIN AS WIP / YELLOW)**
*label - ITP No. (name of ITP)
label - Rev No. (01 in this case)
label - Date of Issue (01/11/2023)
label - ITP Type - (New or revised)*

**Note: Symal staff must send through ITP details before it gets digitised!** |

**These specific columns pull specific items only:**
– Lot map uploaded (pulls button from a checkpoint specifically named as “1.1.1 - Lot Map”)
– Signed holdpoints (pulls all holdpoints named as “*AUTHORITY HOLDPOINT*” ***but not*** “*SIGN ITP*”)

**The remaining columns pull from their respective textboxes/buttons from “*Lot Conformance*”:**
– Lot Status 
– Lot opened date
– Lot opened by
– Date lot closed
– NCR raised?
– NCR Raised Date
– NCR closed?
– NCR Closed Date
– NCR Number
